## 🛠️ Why We Chose Liberica JDK 21 LTS Over Amazon Corretto

#### Built-in JavaFX Support
Liberica JDK 21 LTS includes JavaFX, simplifying our setup and ensuring compatibility, whereas Amazon Corretto requires separate management of JavaFX.

#### Broad Platform Compatibility
Liberica JDK offers extensive support for Windows (X86 64, X86 32, ARM64) and macOS (ARM and X86), ensuring our app runs smoothly across all targeted platforms.


#### Cross-Platform Focus
BellSoft’s commitment to cross-platform development makes Liberica the ideal choice for our non-cloud, multi-platform project.
